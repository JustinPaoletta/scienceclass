        <h1>THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD</h1>

        <p>One of mankinds <strong>GREATEST</strong> acheivements was developing this technique!</p>
        <p>It is a procedure that has taught us almost everything we know.</p>

                                <p>For the first step, form a question, hopefully one that can be answered! Good
                                        questions start with question words: How, What, When, Who,
                                        Which, Why, or Where? For example, which cup holds the most water? Which of
                                        these four objects do you think will float in water?</p>

                                <p>Background research can include talking together about what they already know
                                        about the question they're asking. Maybe you have a book or have seen a show
                                        about the topic. The goal for this step is to engage your scientist brain in
                                        some thinking.</p>

                                <p>A hypothesis is nothing more than a good guess at an answer to the question from
                                        Step 1.
                                        Ask yourself, "Do you think the red cup or the blue cup will hold more water?"
                                        "Do you think the nail will sink or float? Do you think the tin foil boat will
                                        sink or float?"</p>
                        </div>

                                <p>Here comes the part you have been waiting for! Time to formulate and
                                        carry out the experiment! Carefully observe everything
                                        that happens. Talk out the steps to the experiment as you complete them.
                                        "First, let's fill up our pitcher with water. Then, slowly pour the water into the cup."</p>

                                <p>This step is all about results. What happened in the experiment? Ask yourself, "Did the foil
                                        sink or float?" "Which cup held the most water?" At this stage, you should be able to answer the
                                        question developed in Step 1.</p>

                                <p>Scientists share their results! When you make a discovery you should let other people know about it.
                                        Talk to your family about the steps used to conduct the experiment and about what you learned.</p>
