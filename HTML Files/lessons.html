        <h2>Lesson 1 Magnets (5/16/18)</h2>
        
        <h3>Where We Were: <br><br>Grandma's House</h3>
        
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        
        In this Lesson we learned what Magnets are, what they can be used for, that some things we would never think are magnetic actually are, and most of all that playing with magnets is fun no matter how old you are! 
        <br><br><br><br>

        <div class="bottoml">
        
        <h3>Activities:</h3> 
        
        <h4>Magnetic or Not? -</h4>
        
        I layed out a bunch of items and you seperated them into two Groups,  Those that you thought were Magnetic and those that you did not.<br>  
        <br> 
        We learned that even Grapes and CornFlakes can be Magnetic!
        
        
        <h4>Compass Search -</h4>
        
        We walked around the house using the compass to guide the way. <br><br>  
        
        We learned that you can tell direction with Magnets and that the RED needle on a compass always points North!
        
        
        <h4>Painting With Magnets! -</h4>
        
        We used the strength of a Magnet to move a Paper Clip through Paint and you made a really cool design. <br><br>  
        
        We learned that Magnets are super fun and that they have lots of pratical uses. They are in most Electronic Devices like Microwaves and Smartphones, and if they are strong enough they can even pick up cars!
        
        
        <h3>Other Work</h3>
        
        We did TWO WorkSheets! <br><br>
        
        1) True or False -  You had to decide if the fact about Magnets was True or False. <br><br>
        
        2) Attract or Repel? - You had to decide if the way the Magnets were layed out would Attract or Repel each other!
        
        <br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Homework</h3>
        
        You Had To Study Your Vocabulary Words and Create a Game with Magnets!

        <h2>Lesson 2 Space (5/30/18)</h2>
        
        <h3>Where We Were:<br><br> Uncle Justin's and Aunt Susie's House</h3>
        
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
            
            
                
        In This Lesson We Began Learning About Outer Space!  We Learned that Gravity is the Force that makes Objects fall and that it is what keeps the planets in orbit around our Sun.
        We also learned why the moon has a Powdery Surface and what the order of the Planets are.
        
            <br><br><br>

        <div class="bottoml">
        <h3>Activities:</h3> 
        
        <h4>Gravity Drops -</h4>
        
        I dropped a bunch of different objects from the roof and you guessed which ones would fall quicker.<br>  
        <br> 
        We learned that unless an object has a lot of air resistance everything falls at the same speed! In a Vaccum aka the moon all objects will fall at the same rate all the time due to no air being present.
        
        
        <h4> Moon Dust Craters-</h4>
        
        We threw rocks into a container of 'moondust' and learned how craters are formed. <br><br>  
        
        We also learned that the footprints from the moon landing are still there undisturbed because there is no wind!
        
        
        <h4>Order of The Planets -</h4>
        
        We colored in all of the planets and then spaced them out in the order you guessed they are from the Sun, then we compared it with the actual order. Finally we went outside and layed out the planets according to their current position in the night sky. <br><br>  
        
        We learned that the rocky planets are the closest to the Sun and the Gas Giants are farther away. 
        
        <h4>Solar Still -</h4>

        I prepared a Solar Still using a big plastic bowl, a rubber band, saran wrap, a rock, dirty water, and a small cup. <br><br> 
        
        Using the power of the Sun we learned that through vaporization the water can be made clean and safe to drink.  We tasted the water and it was fresh!

        <h4>Solar Oven -</h4>

        We Built a Solar Oven using cardboard, tin foil, a picture frame and glue. <br><br> 
        
        This was another example of how we can harvest the energy of the Sun and use it in a practical way.
        
        <br><br><br><br>
        
        <h3>Homework</h3>
        
        You Had To Study Your Vocabulary Words and find the answers to questions about your favorite Planet!  You also had to cook quesadillas in your Solar Oven!

        <h3>Where We Were:<br><br> Uncle Justin's and Aunt Susie's House</h3>
        
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
            
            
                
        In This Lesson We Started Exploring What Can Happen Once You Mix Substances Together. 
        We Learned That Certain Substances When Mixed Can Cause Crazy Interactions While Others Don't React At All.

        <h3>Activities:</h3> 
        
        <h4>Eggs in Jars! -</h4>
        
        We took 4 different mason jars and put a hard boiled egg in each one. We filled them with Coca Cola, Kool Aid , and Vinegar.  We left one jar with nothing but the egg and air (This was our control for the experiment). 

        <br>  
        <br> 
        We learned that acidic substances can cause the shell of an egg to dissolve and leave behind a weird somewhat 'bouncy' inside.  Non-Acidic substances such as the air and the Kool-Aid did not produce the same reaction.
        
        
        <h4> Black Snake-</h4>
        
        In the spirit of the 4th of July we took Sugar, Baking Soda, and Lighter Fluid and watched as we caught it on fire!   <br><br>  
        
        We learned that heat can be an important part of chemical reactions, and we also learned how the popular firework is made. 
        
        
        <h4>Rock Candy -</h4>
        
        We boiled water and added sugar to it until it would no longer dissolve anymore. We also added Kool-Aid to the mix for extra flavor. 

         <br><br>  
        
        We learned that the sugary substance will start to crystallize and grow into a Tasty Treat! . 
        
        <h4>Invisible Ink -</h4>

        We wrote out a message on paper with three different liquids.  Lemon Juice, Water , and Ginger Pineapple Water. <br><br> 
        
        We learned that the acid in the lemon juice will chemically react with heat and 'burn' our message into the paper for good!

        <h4>Borax Slime -</h4>

        We made colored slime out of Borax and Glue! <br><br> 
        
        This was a perfect example of how two completely different substances can be combined to make an entirely new one.  And a Super fun one at that!
        
        <br><br><br><br>
        
        <h3>Homework</h3>
        
        You Had To Study Your Vocabulary Words, Observe the Eggs and record what happened, finally you had to design your own experiment following the Scientific Method.  You Chose to do an Egg Drop!

        <h3>Overview:</h3>
            
            
                
        In This Lesson We Started Exploring What's Under Ground.  It's not just the dirt you see if you dig a hole in the yard. The Earth has 4 main layers to it, and in this lesson we learned about what they are composed of, how they change over time, and the purposes they serve!

        <h4>Shake Table! -</h4>
        
        We built a bunch of different buildings out of various materials and then shook them till they broke apart!

        <br>  
        <br> 
        We learned that certain types of structures are better at withstanding Earthquakes than others.
        
        
        <h4> Volcano-</h4>
        
        We made a higher powered volcano than the one we did for fun a while back. <br><br>  
        
        We learned that volcanoes can cause Earthquakes and that the Earth's crust slowly gets replaced by volcanic eruptions. We also learned that not all volcanoes are on land, most of them are underwater! 
        
        
        <h4>Mining-</h4>
        
        We mined for chocolate chips using "tools" such as toothpicks and paper clips.

         <br><br>  
        
        We learned that this is similar to how we extract resources from the ground. The ground provides us with almost everything we need to survive and thrive! 
        
        <h4>Pangea Puzzle-</h4>

        We pieced together the continents as they were millions of years ago and discovered some really cool facts. <br><br> 
        
        We learned that the continents all used to be connected together in one huge landmass and we refer to that by the name of Pangea (meaning, "All the Earth").

         <h4>SnowBall Fight! -</h4>
         
         We made snow out of shaving cream and baking powder and had a snowball fight in the front yard!
 
         <br>  
         <br> 
         We learned that theres other types of precipitation besides just rain and snow. Sleet and Hail are two other types.
         
         
         <h4> Shaving Cream Clouds-</h4>
         
         We made clouds out of shaving cream and got to watch it "rain" in a mason jar. <br><br>  
         
         We learned that rain is caused by clouds that cant hold anymore water. Once they have all they can hold they start to drop it. 
         
         
         <h4>Four Seasons Sorting -</h4>
         
         We sorted facts according to the season we thought it would be associated with.
 
          <br><br>  
         
         We learned lots of cool facts, such as the Earth is closest to the Sun during the WINTER.
